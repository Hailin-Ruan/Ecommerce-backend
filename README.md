## Project Description

E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, is a dynamic and rapidly growing sector of the global economy. It involves the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. This digital marketplace has transformed the way businesses and consumers interact, offering convenience, accessibility, and a wide array of options.

The backbone of any e-commerce platform is its backend system, which handles the complex processes that power online transactions. The backend consists of databases, servers, APIs, and other components that work behind the scenes to deliver a seamless shopping experience.

This back-end application is a functional Express.js API utilising Sequelize to interact with MySQL database. 
With the help of Insomnia Core, the user is able to:
**GET routes for ALL**
- categories
- products
- tags
**GET routes for a SINGLE**
- category
- product
- tag
**POST, PUT and DELETE routes for**
- categories
- products
- tags
